### Filtering

- For filtering the data, we use a filter option
- First select the data (Ctrl + A)
- next press (ctrl + shift  + L) for adding/removing filters 





### Sorting

In sorting data gets rearranged 
- we use (Alt + H + s) short cut for sorting
- We use sorting on data but not on the header, so it's better to choose on data

### Custom Sorting

- So here we can apply multiple sorts at once
- First select the data and in the home ribbon in the editing section -> filter and sort -> custom sort
- from there, we can select that and apply to multiple columns
